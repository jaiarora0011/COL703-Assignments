The lexer and parser are the same one that was submitted in Assingment 1 by me and I have not taken anyone else's implementation for the same.

Instructions for use:
1. Some sample testcases are present in the 'testcases' folder, and all the output files are generated in the 'output' folder.
2. Each output file tells if the original formula was a tautology or not. If not, then it contains Falsifying assignments for the formula.
3. The main folder has a Makefile. Running 'make test' will take all '.flasl' input files in the testcases folder and run the tableau method on them
4. 'make clean' will remove all the extraneous files.
